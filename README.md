### 0.1.1 - beta

the don't want to do math homework update

### TL;DR
i had some spare time on my hands so i figured out how to add language support for premake.
this is done use `auto` generated lua meta files wich the extension then injects in to the workspace wich a lua language extension can then use

there are still some issues due to the fact that no all the premake docs are formatted the same

**Enjoy!**
